Technical Assignment: Component Improvement and Visual Redesign for Vector Space (VeSp)

  Project Context
   - Project: Vector Space (VeSp) - Interactive web sandbox for visualizing linear algebra concepts
   - Methodology: GRACE (Graph-RAG Anchored Code Engineering) - following formalized XML contracts approach
   - Target Users: Students (primary), teachers and math enthusiasts (secondary)
   - Priority: Maintain educational focus while improving code quality and visual consistency
   - Implementation Approach: Phased approach - component refactoring first, visual consistency second

  Objectives

  Primary Objectives
   1. Refactor the InspectorPanel component for better maintainability without changing UI structure
   2. Fix visual inconsistencies across all UI components while maintaining educational focus

  Secondary Objectives
   1. Ensure code remains compatible with existing GRACE contracts
   2. Maintain existing functionality while improving code quality
   3. Preserve the mathematical visualization focus of the application

  Component Improvement Requirements

  InspectorPanel Refactoring
  Current Issues:
   - Single file with 500+ lines of code
   - Mixed concerns (object properties, math operations, multi-selection handling)
   - Difficult to maintain and extend

  Refactoring Approach:
   1. Extract sub-components within InspectorPanel while maintaining the same visual structure:
      - ObjectPropertiesPanel - handles object property editing
      - MultiSelectionPanel - handles multi-object operations
      - MathOperationsPanel - handles mathematical operations
      - VectorPropertiesEditor - handles vector-specific properties
      - MatrixPropertiesEditor - handles matrix-specific properties

   2. Maintain the same props interface and store interactions
   3. Keep the same visual organization and layout
   4. Preserve all existing functionality and behavior

  Additional Component Improvements
   1. Toolbar Component:
      - Standardize button styles across all toolbar buttons
      - Ensure consistent hover/focus states
      - Maintain existing functionality and placement

   2. UI Consistency:
      - Create consistent styling patterns for all UI components
      - Standardize spacing, colors, and visual hierarchy
      - Maintain absolute positioning as per current design

  Visual Redesign Requirements

  Visual Consistency Standards
   1. Color Palette:
      - Primary: #007bff (existing blue for active buttons)
      - Secondary: #6c757d (existing gray for disabled/special buttons)
      - Background: rgba(30, 30, 30, 0.9) (existing dark panel background)
      - Text: #e0e0e0 (existing light text)
      - Error: #c0392b (existing red for delete button)
      - Selection: #007bff with visual emphasis

   2. Spacing Standards:
      - Panel padding: 15px
      - Section padding: 10px
      - Button margins: 4px 2px
      - Button padding: 8px 12px
      - Input margins: 8px

   3. Typography:
      - Maintain existing font sizes and weights
      - Ensure sufficient contrast ratios for readability
      - Use consistent label sizes and heading hierarchy

   4. Visual Elements:
      - Use consistent border-radius: 8px for panels
      - Use consistent border: 1px solid rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1) for panels
      - Use consistent backdrop-filter: blur(10px) for panels
      - Maintain existing z-index values

  Visual Enhancement Goals
   1. Improve visual hierarchy to help students focus on mathematical concepts
   2. Ensure sufficient contrast for educational accessibility
   3. Maintain clean, academic aesthetic
   4. Preserve the mathematical visualization focus

  Implementation Phases

  Phase 1: Component Refactoring (Week 1)
   1. Refactor InspectorPanel into sub-components
   2. Maintain all existing functionality
   3. Update import statements in parent components
   4. Test functionality after each refactoring step

  Phase 2: Visual Consistency Implementation (Week 2)
   1. Apply consistent styling patterns across all UI components
   2. Fix visual inconsistencies identified in assessment
   3. Maintain existing positioning and functionality
   4. Ensure all components meet accessibility standards

  Quality Assurance Requirements

  Code Quality
   1. Maintain existing store interactions and API contracts
   2. Preserve all existing functionality and user workflows
   3. Follow existing code style and conventions
   4. Ensure no breaking changes to parent component interfaces

  Testing Requirements
   1. All mathematical operations must continue to function as before
   2. Object creation, selection, and manipulation must work identically
   3. Multi-selection functionality must remain unchanged
   4. State persistence via URL must continue to work

  Visual Standards
   1. Maintain high contrast ratios for readability (minimum 4.5:1)
   2. Ensure consistent visual feedback for interactions
   3. Preserve mathematical visualization focus
   4. Maintain responsive positioning across screen sizes

  Deliverables

   1. Refactored InspectorPanel component with sub-components
   2. Consistent styling applied across all UI components
   3. Updated component documentation
   4. Comprehensive testing to ensure no functionality is broken
   5. Updated import statements in parent components

  Success Criteria
   - [ ] All existing functionality preserved
   - [ ] Improved code maintainability
   - [ ] Consistent visual design across UI components
   - [ ] No breaking changes to existing API contracts
   - [ ] Code follows existing project conventions
   - [ ] Educational focus maintained
   - [ ] Visual hierarchy improved for student learning

  Constraints
   1. Must maintain compatibility with existing GRACE methodology contracts
   2. No changes to UI structure - only code refactoring and visual improvement
   3. Preserve existing state management patterns
   4. Maintain existing keyboard interactions
   5. Keep mathematical visualization as primary focus
