# Quickstart: Dynamic Expression UX

This feature enhances the expression input experience in the vector visualization tool.

## Single-Line Expression Input

The expression input is now a single-line field, similar to Desmos. You can type long expressions and the field will scroll horizontally.

## Live LaTeX Preview

As you type a mathematical expression, a live LaTeX preview is rendered to show you the formatted output in real-time.

## Ghost Vector Visualization

When you write an expression that involves a pre-defined vector, a "ghost" vector is displayed on the canvas to visualize the operation. For example, if you have a vector `v1` defined, you can type `v1 + [1,1,1]` to see a ghost vector representing the addition.
